# Multi-Purpose-Toolbox-for-Medical-Image-Manipulation
Under Development

## These tools represent famous image processing algorithms with special highlight on medical ones written from scratch in view of building a solid foundation and understanding for more advanced image processing work
These represent the tasks of academic course of **Medical Image Processing and Computer Vision** which includes the topic of:
- Spacial filtering
- Frequency domain filtering
- Image restoration
- Image reconstruction
- Color image processing
- Morphological Image Processing
- Image segmentation

Each task folder contains:
- .ui file(s) generated using *PyQt Designer*
- .py file of GUI interface
- .py file of main program
- Sample images for illustration
- PDF document for program functionalities

All programs are properly documented with explanation of steps, algorithms and comments.
